                        <p>I want to take a moment to tell you what you mean to me. Every day with you is a gift I never knew I needed.</p>

                        <p>From the moment I met you, I felt something different. It wasn't just attraction or chemistry—it was a deeper connection. You understood me in ways I didn't expect. You saw me for who I truly am and loved me anyway.</p>

                        <p>Your smile brightens my darkest days. Your laugh is like music to my ears. The way you care about others, the kindness in your heart, the strength in your spirit—these things inspire me every single day.</p>

                        <p>You've become my best friend, my confidant, and my safe place. When I'm with you, I feel at home. When I'm without you, I think of all the moments we've shared and smile, thinking about all the moments yet to come.</p>

                        <p>I love the little things—the way you look when you're concentrating, your sense of humor, how you dance even when there's no music, the way you hold my hand, everything about you.</p>

                        <p>But beyond all that, I love who I am when I'm with you. You make me want to be better, to dream bigger, to love deeper.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 2em; font-size: 1.3em; color: #ff1493;">
                            So I'm asking you now, with all my heart:<br><br>
                            <strong>Will you be my Valentine?</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 2em;">I promise to cherish you, to support your dreams, to make you laugh, to hold you when you're sad, and to love you with everything I have.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 2em;">Forever yours,</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 1em; font-style: italic;">Your Person 💕</p>
